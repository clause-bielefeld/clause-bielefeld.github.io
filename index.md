Generally, we work on natural language processing and on learning models for language generation & understanding from data. We would like to develop machines that use language as flexibly and smoothly as humans do. This is why we are particularly interested in **c**omputational modeling of **la**nguage **use**, visual language grounding, reference, pragmatics and dialogue.
