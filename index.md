# Computational Models of Language Use

<span style="font-size:4em;"> Welcome to our group website! We are computational linguists, in Bielefeld. We work on computational models of language generation & understanding and on developing machines that use language as flexibly and smoothly as humans do.</span>

This is a photo from the past of CLAUSE. Once, we were located at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. We have now moved to Uni Bielefeld. We will update the photo as soon as the first group hike into Teutoburger Wald has taken place.
