Our research focus is on building well-performing computational models which use language 
to perform various tasks on a human-like level. This includes multimodal activities like combining
computer vision and language in form of spoken words or written text. If you are interested 
in our research find our publications and activites listed below or feel free to contact ous 
for any kind of cooperation!
